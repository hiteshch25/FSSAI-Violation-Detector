FSSAI makes closure report of food safety licences mandatory for FBOs

The order in this direction by the food safety authority of the country says that the closure report has been made mandatory to maintain transparency and traceability in the licensing framework.",https://hospitality.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/operations/food-and-beverages/fssai-mandates-closure-reports-for-expired-food-safety-licences/121343569,Unknown,2025-06-20 22:41:17
FSSAI does a U-turn on its role in monitoring violations of baby food law,"Representative Image

Four and a half years after issuing an advisory asking food safety officers in states and union territories to monitor violations of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act which regulates promotion and marketing of baby foods, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) has done an about turn stating that the IMS Act did not come under its purview.FSSAI stated this in response to an RTI query filed in March 2025 asking for details of any action taken for monitoring the IMS Act and for information regarding any training sessions conducted for designated officers and food commissioners. It also sought reports from the monitoring of violations of the Act. FSSAI responded on April 1 stating that the IMS Act did not come under the purview of FSSAI and that it falls in the domain of the ministry of women and child development.In the advisory issued in September 2020, FSSAI stated that Section 100 of the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006 read with the relevant section of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act empowered the designated officer or the food safety officer to make a written complaint before the court to take cognizance of any violation punishable under the IMS Act. The advisory to all central licensing authorities, designated officers of FSSAI and commissioners of food safety of all states and union territories asked them to closely monitor the products and promotional activities of food business operators (FBOs) and any non-profit or association or instate established by the FBOs to determine if they were violating any provisions of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act.Section 12 of the IMS Act dealing with powers of entry and search states that “any Food Safety Officer appointed under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 …or any officer not below the rank of a Class I officer authorised in this behalf by the State Government” has the power to enter and search if any provision of the law was contravened. Section 21 of the IMS Act dealing with cognizance of offences states that no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act except upon a complaint in writing made by “the Designated Officer or the Food Safety Officer directed under sub-section (5) of section 42 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006…”FSSAI’s response contradicts the explicit provisions of the law, which mandate that food safety officers be empowered as authorized officers to protect infant health, said a statement issued by the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) adding that this resulted in a bureaucratic void in which violations – such as unchecked sponsorships and promotional activities by infant formula companies were effectively given free rein. In 1995, the union government had notified BPNI to monitor the compliance with the IMS Act. BPNI has been monitoring and reporting on the alleged violations of the baby food law IMS Act that prohibits any form of promotion or advertisements of baby foods for children under two years.Expressing deep concern over the persistent gaps in the enforcement of the IMS Act, the BPNI statement appealed to the PMO to revise the prevailing business rules which lay down the areas of responsibility of each ministry. BPNI sought reassigning enforcement responsibilities of the IMS Act from women and child development ministry to the health ministry so that “those best equipped with medical expertise and a robust presence in healthcare service delivery” were at the forefront of protecting infant health. This realignment is not only critical to upholding the law that once championed India’s commitment to breastfeeding, but it is also essential for meeting our national health targets, including the early initiation of breastfeeding, which currently stands at a mere 41%, concluded the statement.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fssai-does-a-u-turn-on-its-role-in-monitoring-violations-of-baby-food-law/articleshow/120162084.cms,Unknown,2025-06-20 22:41:19

Was your food stale? You can soon lodge a plaint on UP govt app,"



Noida: The food safety department rolled out an initiative allowing customers to directly submit their feedback on an app to improve food quality and flag safety violations.The grievance redressal and feedback mechanism was added as a feature in Food Safety Connect app, which was launched in Oct 2021 by Food Safety and Drug Administration and was being used by food business operators to register their establishments till now.""Earlier, the app did not have a grievance redressal mechanism. Now, the software will screen and filter complaints and send them to the officials concerned. Complaints will also be monitored at the state level for follow-ups,"" said Arvind Kumar Yadav, assistant commissioner (food), Ghaziabad.Moreover, as part of an initiative to improve food safety, restaurants and sweets shops will be required to prominently display customer feedback posters at their establishments. The poster will carry the name, address, email ID, mobile number, and the food registration or licence number of the establishment.Customers can use these details to submit their feedback or lodge complaints on Food Safety Connect app or call the toll-free number 1800-180-5533.Clarifying that the app was not a food review app, Sarvesh Mishra, assistant commissioner (food-2), Noida, said, ""This app is strictly for reporting food safety violations.It is not to review the outlets' services or food's taste.""""The data from the app will be integrated with that from existing grievance redressal mechanisms such as the FSSAI website, consumer forums, and complaints made on email,"" he added.Food operators are legally required to display their FSSAI licence prominently at their outlets. The licence numbers will now play a crucial role in identifying and acting on complaints. Currently, the food safety departments on an average receive around 10 complaints a month, officials said, adding that with introduction of the new feature in the app, authorities expect better reporting and compliance.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/was-your-food-stale-you-can-soon-lodge-a-plaint-on-up-govt-app/articleshow/120390813.cms,Unknown,2025-06-20 22:41:31
Restaurants and eateries fined for food safety violations in Mysuru,"A two-day campaign to check food safety violations in hotels and restaurants launched in the city by the Food Safety and Standards Department under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare commenced on Friday, August 30, and by evening, lapses were found in at least 16 eateries and restaurants that were inspected.

The drive is being held to enforce the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) Act 2006 and will cover as many eateries and hotels as possible within the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) limits.

S.L. Ravindra, Designated Officer for Mysuru City, said the objective is to ensure and enforce hygiene and cleanliness at eateries and restaurants. Of the 22 hotels and street vendors that were inspected till late in the evening, 16 of them, all near the Mysuru Zoo, were found to be violating one aspect of the law or the other.

A majority of them were found to be operating without renewing their licenses which had expired while there were cases of ingredients past their shelf life or expiry date, being used for making tea etc., said Mr. Ravindra.

On finding violations and lapses, a fine of ₹33,000 was imposed though there were no cases that warranted cancellation of licenses due to lack of hygiene.

The team led by Mr. Ravindra comprised three food safety officers including Mr. Girish, Mr. Rajesh, and Ms. Dakshayani. After inspecting the eateries near the zoo, hotels on Nelson Mandela Road, Kalidasa Road, and Vijayanagar were checked for violations if any, of the food safety act and the provisions of FSSAI.

Apart from counselling the owners of eateries on how to resolve the violations and comply with the regulations, the inspecting team distributed handouts and literature highlighting various provisions of the law that need to be adhered to by the hotel and eatery owners. They were also apprised of the hefty fines that could be levied under different sections of the law.

But more than imposing fines, the objective was to reinforce the imperatives of complying with the FSSAI norms as it has a bearing on the public health, said Mr. Ravindra.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/restaurants-and-eateries-fined-for-food-safety-violations-in-mysuru/article68585737.ece,2024-08-30,2025-06-20 22:41:33

After starting a probe into alleged violation of norms in branded spices , food regulator FSSAI plans to launch surveillance on other food items like fortified rice, dairy products and spices sold in the domestic market. According to sources, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is planning surveillance on food items like fruit and vegetables, salmonella in fish products; spice and culinary herbs; fortified rice; and milk and milk products.FSSAI is already taking samples of spices in powder form of all brands, including MDH and Everest, from across the country in view of quality concerns flagged by Singapore and Hong Kong.""In view of the current development, FSSAI is taking samples of spices of all brands, including MDH and Everest, from the market to check whether they meet the FSSAI norms,"" a source had said on April 22.FSSAI does not regulate the quality of exported spices, sources said.Early last month, Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety (CFS) asked consumers not to buy and traders not to sell MDH's Madras Curry Powder (spice blend for Madras curry), Everest Fish Curry Masala, MDH Sambhar Masala Mixed Masala Powder, and MDH Curry Powder Mixed Masala Powder.The CFS had said that samples of several kinds of pre-packaged spice-mix products of two Indian brands were found to contain a pesticide ethylene oxide. Singapore Food Agency also directed a recall of such spices. After Hong Kong's directive, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) also ordered a recall of imported 'Everest Fish Curry Masala' from India.Last week, FSSAI said it was in the process of collecting pan-India samples of Nestle's Cerelac baby cereals, amid a global report claiming that the company was adding higher sugar content to the product.According to sources, FSSAI carries out various pan-India surveillance on various food products to assess the compliance status of implemented regulations.The number of samples analysed during the past few years has grown substantially from 1,07,829 in 2020-21 to more than 4,51,000 in 2023-24, registering an increase of more than 3 times.In 2020-21, 1,07,829 samples were analysed and 28,347 samples were found non-conforming.

Strengthening Food Safety: Calls for Stricter Penalties for Violations in Hyderabad,"Hyderabad: Food safety officials emphasise the urgent need for stricter penalties against eatery operators who violate guidelines.Currently, the fines imposed range from 5,000 to 10,000. Even larger establishments, such as pubs and resto bars, face only 20,000 in fines for violations. Adjudicating officers have the authority to impose fines up to 5 lakh, and they should utilise this power to ensure that eateries do not serve substandard food, said a source within the food safety department.Officials also stress the need for customer involvement in reporting food-related issues using platforms like the Food Safety Connect app or tagging official handles such as @AFCGHMC and @cfs_telangana on ‘X'. Additionally, consumers can also lodge complaints through toll-free number, 9100105795.""It is crucial for operators and handlers to participate in the Food Safety Training and Certification (FoSTaC) programme, which is mandatory for all the personnel involved in the food business. This provides training in handling, preparation, and manufacturing practices to uphold standards and enhance customer satisfaction. It equips them with a better understanding of food production, processing, packaging, and storage,"" said a senior food safety official.He further added, ""Owners must implement effective pest control measures to prevent infestations of rats and cockroaches. They should check labels and expiration dates to ensure that expired products are not used. Daily water analysis is vital, and kitchens should be kept clean and free of stagnation.""Despite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) launching a hygiene rating system in 2019, only 60 out of 74,000 eateries have adopted it so far. ""This reflects a lack of seriousness among management in embracing this voluntary system,"" said an official even as members of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) acknowledged the challenges in getting more establishments on board.""There are only a handful of agencies available to conduct third-party audits for hygiene ratings. The FSSAI needs to engage more empanelled third-party agencies to ensure the authenticity of these ratings,"" said Sandeep Balasubramaniam, co-chapter head of NRAI Hyderabad.The hygiene rating system relies on audits by third-party agencies tasked with monitoring food preparation quality in hotel kitchens.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/strengthening-food-safety-calls-for-stricter-penalties-for-violations-in-hyderabad/articleshow/114292975.cms,Unknown,2025-06-20 22:41:42

Visible food safety violations to attract spot fine from now on,"Visible violations by Food Business Operators (FBOs) are expected to see a decline with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) all set to start levying spot fines.

As per a new directive, Designated Officers of the FSSAI in each district can now impose spot fine on FBOs who are found with certain visible violations.

While violation for the first and second time attracts fine, repetition of the same violation for a third time will attract a higher amount of fine and cancellation of the registration certificate issued by the food regulator.

The spot fine is also expected to have an impact on the sale of banned products like gutka as seizure of any such item for a third time will attract cancellation of registration certificate and a spot fine of ₹ 25,000, the highest fine among all violations.

K. Tamilselvan, Designated Officer of FSSAI for Coimbatore, said that the spot fine system was expected to have a deterrent effect on FBOs that repeatedly flouted food safety norms.

“The new directive empowers Designated Officers to levy spot fine when a food is found containing extraneous matter, FBOs failing to comply with directions of food safety officers, unhygienic or unsanitary processing or manufacturing and sale of food items,” he said.

FBOs, who are slapped with a spot fine, will have to pay the amount at the treasury and food safety officers cannot collect the penalty as cash. If the FBOs fail to pay the penalty within the stipulated time, the Designated Officer can suspend the registration certificate of the FBO until the penalty is paid.

According to Dr. Tamilselvan, misbranding, label violations, possession of banned food products and adulteration in certain food items are among the common visible violations found in Coimbatore.

“The spot fine applies to the possession of banned food item like gutka when the seized quantity is less than that of the sample quantity. Sample quantity means the quantity required to lift four separate samples of the same item for laboratory analysis. Now, even if a vendor is found with two or three sachets of different gutka, spot fine can be levied,” he explained.

Stating that levy of spot fine would have a deterrent effect on violators, Coimbatore-based lawyer and consumer rights activist V.P. Sarathi said that the food safety officers should also strictly implement other provisions of the FSSAI Act to bring down other violations by FBOs.

Citing an incident wherein he found worm in a packaged drinking water a year ago, sample of which was subsequently found “unfit for human consumption” in a laboratory analysis, Mr. Sarathi said that the food regulator only served a ‘caution notice’ to the manufacturer.

“Such offences should have seen a logical end of prosecution by the court and heavy fine should have been imposed on the violator,” he opined.

A meat stall owner with whom The Hindu spoke to said that the spot fine would not affect traders, who sold quality meat to customers, but would help buyers understand those who sold sub-standard items.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/visible-food-safety-violations-to-attract-spot-fine-from-now-on/article30270938.ece,2019-12-10,2025-06-20 22:42:09
